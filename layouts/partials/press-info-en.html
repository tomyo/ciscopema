      Cisco Pema, bassist, singer and producer from Buenos Aires/Berlin continues his solo career with a new album. After four years and more than hundred concerts in different parts of Europe, Cisco Pema presents his third album "Otra realidad". A rhythmic album with dreamy sounds and an unconventional brass section. With "Otra realidad" Pema creates a modern vision of South American music.
      On the road in a trio with Bernhard Geigl on keyboards and Christoph Stadler on drums, Pema brings a compact version of his new songs to the stage. The Viennese musicians' ability to improvise, together with Pema's dynamic style, allows for a powerful performance.
