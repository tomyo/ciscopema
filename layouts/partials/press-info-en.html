      Electric bassist Cisco Pema is no new face in the music industry. Growing up in Argentina, he started out in rock bands in Buenos Aires before exploring the diverse world of South American music on the Rio de la Plata. He then settled in Linz, Austria, to study for a Bachelor’s Degree in Jazz Bass. There he founded several hip hop bands and played in numerous reggae projects. Given these eclectic tastes and experiences, it won’t come as a surprise that he later touched down in Europe’s most diverse musical city: Berlin where in 2016 he released his debut album “Cisco Pema”.
With his new EP "Tu casa es mi casa" he takes us on a trip through different worlds of his creation. Accompanied by his renowned colleagues from the band Jamaram, Cisco Pema manages to capture the colorful splendor of his adventures in the studio and express them in five powerful pieces.
